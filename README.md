# Robo Spiders In Space!

This is a project I am working on to learn c++ and computer graphics programming.

To do list:

1. change enemy motion to be at an angle plus or minus some offset instead of a vector plus or minus some offset.
<!-- 
    -something like plus or minus 10 degrees
    -does not need to be updated every time
 -->
2. animate the player and enemy.

3. any object that can trigger an animation needs to receive the pointer to the scene's animator in it's update function

4. make all four corners potnetial spawn points

5. implement player enemy collision detection

6. fix bug of mouse pointer rotation after resizng window


Completed:

1. make player point towards the mouse

2. make enemies point towards player

3. use array for enemies instead of vector

4. made projectiles a bitmap pointing in proper direction instead of a plain rectangle.

5. added an animation of an explosion

6. fix the mess of bitmap assignment
