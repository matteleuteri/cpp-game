# cpp-game

This is a project I am working on to learn c++ and computer graphics programming.

To do list:

1. change enemy motion to be at an angle plus or minus some offset instead of a vector plus or minus some offset.
<!-- 
    -something like plus or minus 10 degrees
    -does not need to be updated every time
 -->
2. animate the player and enemy.
